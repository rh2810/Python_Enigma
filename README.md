# Python_Enigma
Version 3:
This program encodes characters into numbers, similar to a Caesar Cipher.

When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter one of three inputs: 'e', 'd', or 'q'.

'e' - encrypts the users input into a 'secret' code.

'd' - decrypts the users input (from code form) into their normal representation.

'q' - quits the program.

Version 4:

't' - A table that displays the characters and their 'secret' code translation.
